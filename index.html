        who would've thought that you were taking a pic of your future
        boyfriend. what a completely different time in our lives. sometimes i
        like to visit this picture because i find it entertaining how
        unsuspecting we were of our future. it was just dance practice

        what a fitting spot for our first date. i remember realizing, 5 minutes
        after we sat down, that all the things i wanted to do 2 years prior...i
        still wanted to do. hug you, kiss you, help you, listen to you, lift
        you, make you watch horror movies, kick you. it all came rushing back

        this day was so telling to me. we had an action-packed day of going to
        patricia's and then to the jesus retreat reunion right after. i was
        worried that i would shut down given all the socializing. especially
        with some faces i had always anticipated seeing: grace lee, greenhouse
        folks, angela, JONNY ;) but you were such a comfort to me, getting advil
        with me, offering some rest time in the car, caring for me. wifey
        material.

        what a rollercoaster that dinner was in my mind. but i wouldn't have
        asked for the first family encounter to be any different. they were the
        best people to meet first. i had such a great, warm time. the food was
        so yum. and i had my pink hoodie tak cutie right there the whole time.

      <p>
        quarantine sucks in so many ways. but it gave us a really interesting
        journey, and that led to so many engaging conversations. we still used
        the time to get to know each other more deeply. there were a lot of days
        when we didn't really do much. but i never grew tired of hearing about
        your day.

      those aren't necessarily my top memories, but just a random few of them.
      there are way too many to code

    <div id="page-9" class="page">
      i love you grace tak. to me, you're the biggest light on this earth. you
      make my troubles so much lighter, and you give my strengths a mission and
      purpose. i'm so thankful for this past year, where God has shown me some
      quality goodness through you.
    </div>

    <div id="page-10" class="page">
      and yet there's so much time ahead of us. i can't wait to see all the new
      ways where i can experience your beauty and how it keeps on giving to me,
      effortlessly. and i'm also waiting for when things get tough. i know
      they'll just be more ways that God will shape us. and make me appreciate
      you even more.
